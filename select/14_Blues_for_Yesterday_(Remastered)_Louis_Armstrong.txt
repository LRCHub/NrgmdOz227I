I've got the Blues for yesterday, it keeps on hauntin' me
I've got the Blues for yesterday, it keeps on hauntin' me
I got the Blues deep down, the days that used to be

I like to sit by the fire side, dreamin' of the days gone past
I like to sit by the fire side, dreamin' of the days gone past
Wonderin' why those happy hours, were never meant to last

I got a memr'y in Chicago, a mem'ry in New Orleans
Mem'ries in Saint Louis, it comes back in my dreams
I got a whole gang o' mem'ries, of every town it seems

Now me and my mem'ries, are all so far apart
So a bad man's got my woman, and the blues got my heart
I've got the Blues for yesterday, it keeps on hauntin' me
I got the Blues deep down, the days that used to be
