[00:05.06] Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
[00:13.53] Now it looks as though they're here to stay
[00:17.24] Oh, I believe in yesterday
[00:30.24] 
[00:22.64] Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
[00:30.02] There's a shadow hanging over me
[00:34.37] Oh, yesterday came suddenly
[00:47.87] 
[00:39.88] Why she had to go
[00:44.20] I don't know, she wouldn't say
[00:49.54] I said something wrong
[00:54.10] Now I long for yesterday
[01:06.10] 
[00:59.87] Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
[01:07.87] Now I need a place to hide away
[01:11.77] Oh, I believe in yesterday
[01:24.77] 
[01:17.47] Why she had to go
[01:21.73] I don't know, she wouldn't say
[01:27.20] I said something wrong
[01:31.53] Now I long for yesterday
[01:43.53] 
[01:37.40] Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
[01:45.42] Now I need a place to hide away
[01:49.23] Oh, I believe in yesterday
